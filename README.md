Doshisha University Network Authentication
==========================================

Every few hours or so at Doshisha University (同志社大学), one has to retype their UserID/Password combination and login to the Doshisha network before being able to browse the internet. I got very tired typing those in, so I made a small userscript that enables the browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to do the autofill for me; simple but effective.

- Redirects login window popup to current page.
- Enables autocomplete for the login form.
